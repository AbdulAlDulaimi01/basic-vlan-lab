# Basic VLAN and Inter-VLAN Routing Lab (CCNA)

This project simulates a small office network using VLAN segmentation and inter-VLAN routing via Router-on-a-Stick. It was built in Cisco Packet Tracer and demonstrates core CCNA concepts.

## üñß Topology Overview

- 2 VLANs: HR (10) and IT (20)
- 1 Cisco 2960 Switch
- 1 Cisco 1941 Router
- 4 PCs (2 per VLAN)
- Router-on-a-Stick configuration with sub-interfaces

## üß± IP Addressing and VLANs

| VLAN | Name | Subnet             | Gateway          | Devices       |
|------|------|--------------------|------------------|---------------|
| 10   | HR   | 192.168.10.0/24    | 192.168.10.1     | HR-PC1, HR-PC2 |
| 20   | IT   | 192.168.20.0/24    | 192.168.20.1     | IT-PC1, IT-PC2 |

## ‚öôÔ∏è What I Configured

- VLANs on the switch
- Port assignment for VLANs
- Trunk port to router
- Sub-interfaces on router for inter-VLAN routing
- Static IPs and default gateways on PCs

## ‚úÖ Testing Results

- Pings between same-VLAN devices ‚úÖ
- Pings across VLANs (inter-VLAN) ‚úÖ
- Pings to default gateways ‚úÖ
